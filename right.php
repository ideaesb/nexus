 <p><strong>NEclimateUS.org</strong> (a.k.a. 'NExUS') is a searchable online database that provides a gateway to climate information for the Eastern US, Atlantic Canada and the maritime region known as the Northwest Atlantic.</p>
 <p>NExUS summarizes available data, tools, plans and reports; climate-related organizations; on-going projects; and needs for climate information identified largely in publications. This search tool for regional climate information seeks to foster collaborative opportunities for climate-related work in the Eastern US and Atlantic Canada. </p>
 
 <p>For more guidance on how to locate resources in NExUS, please see the <a href="using.php">Using NExUS</a> page. The database is still in development and the sponsoring partners welcome <a href="email.php">feedback</a> .</p>
